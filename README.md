## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

The Smart Calculator is a desktop-based calculator designed for accurate and user-friendly input. Unlike most basic calculators, this app includes a **state-aware input system**: once a mathematical operator is entered, all operator buttons are disabled until the user presses `=` to complete the expression. This approach helps prevent malformed inputs like `5++3`.

It was developed to demonstrate UI logic handling, state-based control, and clean design using **Windows Forms** in C#.
